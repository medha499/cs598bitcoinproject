# CS 598 Project #1: Bitcoin Prediction
## Team Members: Abdul R Latif, Lisheng Zhou, Tamara Hahn, Medha Dhir 


Objective: Build predictive models that forecast the Bitcoin market price at multiple horizons- specifically, 1-day, 14-day, and 30-day intervals. By reconstructing the dataset into a supervised learning format, we incorporate lagged historical prices and other blockchain-related predictors to capture temporal dependencies in the data. The analysis leverages Ridge and Lasso regression techniques, not only to improve predictive accuracy but also to highlight which predictors play the most important role in shaping future price movements.
